      <h3>🌍 Travel Tips</h3>
      <p><strong>🎒 Packing Essentials:</strong> Carry light, breathable clothes for summer and warm layers for hilly regions or winters. A travel adapter, power bank, sunscreen, reusable water bottle, and a basic first-aid kit are must-haves.</p>
      <p><strong>🚖 Transportation:</strong> India offers a wide range of transport options—auto-rickshaws, taxis, buses, metros, and trains. Use trusted apps like Ola or Uber in urban areas, and book trains via IRCTC for long journeys.</p>
      <p><strong>🛡️ Health & Safety:</strong> Stay hydrated, avoid street food if you have a sensitive stomach, and use bottled or filtered water. Get travel insurance and necessary vaccinations (like Hepatitis A/B, Typhoid) before your trip.</p>
      <p><strong>💵 Money Matters:</strong> Cash is still widely used in rural areas. ATMs are common in cities. Carry small denominations. Use digital wallets like Paytm or PhonePe in urban regions.</p>
      <p><strong>📅 Best Time to Visit:</strong> October to March is generally pleasant. Monsoon (June–September) is beautiful in some parts but may disrupt travel in others due to heavy rains.</p>
